The landscape of job searching and career planning is more complex than ever with candidates seeking out opportunities that align with their personal interests and more than ever wanting to make an impact and find meaningful work. As such, we would like to build a modern career planning and job searching portal that serves our generation in pursuing organizations that meet their specific criteria. Our web application is more than a traditional job board.

We are creating a platform that assists candidates and employers alike in making recommendations and matching, allows for users to network with like minded peers around common interests, research companies based on not only industry but also company visions, and even upskill themselves on how to become more effective and successful candidates. We are pleased to introduce Better Interview Book, the ultimate job candidate and employer platform for tech professionals.
